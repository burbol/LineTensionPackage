(1)->2 March 2017: NEXT TASKS

- [x] Check simulations with VMD (Version_V2) => first dilute!!!
- [x] Backup finished simulations (in 2 different places at least)
- [ ] CORRECT ERROR: backup output of failed time extension + copy correct simul. output from backup to scratch
- [ ] RUN: Extend simulations to 200ns (Version_V2)
- [ ] RUN: Submit simulations of planar systems (Version_V2) => add vacuum!!!
- [ ] RUN: A couple of simulations with 50% => first make surface bigger!!
- [ ] Calculate GDS (Version_V2)
- [ ] analyze first round (60-100ns) (Version_V2)
- [ ] Analyze second round (extension to 200ns) (version_v2)
- [ ] Determine line tension of Version_v2
- [ ] Submit planar systems of NewVersion_4
- [ ] Calculate GDS of NewVersion_4
- [ ] Determine line tension of NewVersion_4
- [ ] Write paper!!
